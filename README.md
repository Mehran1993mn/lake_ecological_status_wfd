# 🌍 Project Overview

## 📌 Problem Statement

Lakes provide critical ecosystem services including biodiversity support, drinking water, fisheries, and recreation. However, anthropogenic pressures and climate change are accelerating:

- Eutrophication  
- Browning  
- Oxygen depletion  

Under the **EU Water Framework Directive (WFD)**, ecological status is assessed using biological quality elements. These assessments are:

- Expensive  
- Labor intensive  
- Temporally sparse  
- Not near–real-time  

There is currently **no national-scale framework** that predicts WFD ecological status using only routinely measured physicochemical variables.

---

## ⚠️ Challenge Statement

WFD ecological classification is difficult to model because:

- Ecological classes overlap (especially the *Moderate* class)  
- Class imbalance exists (few Bad/Poor lakes)  
- Relationships are nonlinear and multivariate  
- Ecological boundaries are transitional and noisy  

---

## 💡 Solution Statement

This study develops a **national-scale machine learning framework** that:

- Uses only routine water-quality and morphometric variables  
- Compares **RF, XGBoost, SVM, ANN, and TabNet**  
- Implements a **Bayesian Neural Network (BNN)**  
- Decomposes uncertainty into **aleatoric and epistemic components**  
- Applies **SHAP and permutation importance** for interpretability  
- Evaluates probabilistic calibration (ECE & Brier score)

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Classify WFD ecological status from routine variables  
- Identify dominant environmental drivers  
- Quantify predictive uncertainty  
- Provide a scalable complement to biological WFD monitoring  

---

## 📚 Literature Review (Foundational Methods)

This workflow builds upon foundational machine learning and explainability methods:

- Breiman (2001) – Random Forest  
- Cortes & Vapnik (1995) – Support Vector Machine  
- Chen & Guestrin (2016) – XGBoost  
- Arik & Pfister (2021) – TabNet  
- Lundberg & Lee (2017) – SHAP  
- Bayesian Neural Networks with Variational Inference  

---

## 🔎 Research Questions

**RQ1:**  
Can routine water-quality variables predict WFD ecological status at national scale?

**RQ2:**  
Which environmental variables most strongly influence classification?

**RQ3:**  
Does Bayesian modeling improve probability calibration?

**RQ4:**  
Is predictive uncertainty primarily aleatoric or epistemic?

## 🔹 Model Performance

The machine learning framework achieved robust national-scale classification performance:

- Best multi-class macro-F1 ≈ **0.65**
- Binary classification F1 ≈ **0.84**
- Best calibration achieved by **Bayesian Neural Network (ECE = 0.016)**
- Nutrient variables (TP, TN, turbidity) dominate predictive performance
- Moderate class is the most difficult to classify
- Predictive uncertainty is primarily **aleatoric**
